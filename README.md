jprops
=====================================
Matt Good has developed a java properties file parser for Python that is used throughout the
baltrad software and can be found here: https://github.com/mgood/jprops/
The license for jprops can be found in LICENSE.jprops.
Unfortunately there are not many prebuilt distributions of jprops so we have added it as part
of baltrad-utils to avoid conflicts.

To use:
  from baltradutils import jprops
